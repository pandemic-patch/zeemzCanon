Ten thousand years ago, a Terran Seed Ship found an inhabited Goldie Locks planet, called by its inhabitants, “Beorc,” and designated, “GL-148,” by the seed ship's AI, IRIS. After thoroughly scanning the planet, IRIS' Basic Necessities scans returned a green light for offloading 1/3rd of the precious Terran cargo. As per the ship's coding, IRIS released the first compartment, which drove itself from disconnect to surface landing. The compartment then automatically expanded into a self-sufficient village; and this, while the sleeping colonists were slowly defrosted from their long ride in cryogenic freezers. 

One-by-one the groggy colonists meandered to their assigned private quarters within Habitats 1–15. High-level officials & civilians were assigned Habitats 1-3; mid-grade officials & civilians were assigned Habitats 4-8; and, low-grade officials, civilians, & the undesignated were assigned Habitats 9-15. The Habitats formed three linked rings of progressively larger size that were connected by eight hallways utilizing automated security combined with colonist DNA & RFID chips to control access. The “Outer Ring,” as the colonists referred to Habitats 9-15, also had 12 expansion hallways that led outward to 12 outbuildings (kitchen, dining, construction, heavy equipment, education, activities, medical, botanical, weapons, training, agricultural, ag equipment). The “Outer Limits” (a.k.a. the 12 outbuildings) contained 1 of 3 extant copies of all known and collected Terran science, art, and culture; the other two copies hurled away from GL-148 at 1/5th light speed, destination unknown.  As Primary Landing team, the waking colonists knew their charge was to continue Terran civilization. No guarantee existed that CERES-1, the seed ship, would find other suitable locations before being destroyed by some unavoidable calamity. Until CERES-2's 1st landing beacon was triggered, the colonists of GL-148 must assume they were the last of their kind.

The grogginess was followed by a nearly manic-depressive phase whereby the reality of waking up on a foreign planet hit like a tsunami. Colonists quarters were equipped with a fully customizeable, interactive voice assistant; unsurprisingly, named IRIS-IVA. When a colonist registered their baseline biowave, IRIS-IVA's “Welcome to {{ GL-148 }}” message triggered.   


WELCOME {{ COLONIST:Name }}

Over the next few days, your body will acclimate to the predefined settings you specified for your quarters. During this time, you will take refresher courses in the following subjects {{ COLONIST:CourseList }}. These courses are mandatory. Colonists may not leave their Habitat Ring until all assigned refresher courses are successfully completed. To check your refresher course progress, say, “IRIS-IVA, progress Refresher.”

Your Welcome Package is located on your desk. It contains your preloaded smart card, mobile devices, permits, and insignia. Instructions for continuing education requirements are listed in your permits and accessible from your devices. Insert your smart card into any of your devices to begin courses. To check your continuing education progress, say, “IRIS-IVA, progress CE.”

By scanning your permits, you can examine your current access levels and future potential levels. Should you desire to change future potentials, a formal request may be submitted to the Terran Future Potential Council, say, “IRIS-IVA request Potentials.”

TERRA Colony 1 requires all rank holders to display their insignia when leaving their Habitat Ring. One cannot receive the recognition their rank deserves, if they do not have their rank displayed. Failure to display insignia may result in fines, penalties, or reduction of rank. If you are not currently a rank holder, you may earn rank through your actions, continuing education, and dedication to fixing issues located on the Colony Problems & Jobs Board (a.k.a the Board). To access the Board, say, “IRIS-IVA  progress Board.” 

Note: A DNA sample is required for root level access (RLA) of any device or console within TERRA Colony 1. RLA is restricted to device technicians, granted as necessary for course completion, or made available to forensic investigators. If you're experiencing issues with your device, say “IRIS-IVA scan Device.” 

For a full list of IRIS-IVA version 8.13.54 commands, say, “IRIS-IVA display Lexicon” or, for a most frequently used command list, say, “IRIS-IVA display Help.”

You may repeat this message by saying, “IRIS-IVA, repeat Welcome.”
