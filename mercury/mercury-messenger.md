Mercury’s Messengers
by Monique Finley

“Incoming in 3…2…1.” A computerized woman’s voice announced over the palace-wide speaker system. 
The explosion rocked the Southeastern wing of the Iphigenia Palace, where Mercurians were shoving the last of the environmental technicians down an evacuation hatch leading to the recently built escape tunnels. Gilt detritus sped across the ballroom faster than a swarm of angry bees chasing a honey thief. Alec Griffith slammed himself to the mosaic floor and slithered towards the hatch as myriad shards ricocheted off his body armor. For the second time in his life Griffith whispered praise to Mercury, Inc.; after all, the company manufactured armor far superior to anything else ever made. The adamantine hoodie and cargo pants made Kevlar appear as useful as Styrofoam and as bulky as a knight’s suit of armor. Just as Griffith slid head first into the open mouth of the hatch a second deafening blast hit the ballroom. Between the sudden drop and the concrete raining down on him, Griffith felt exalted, somehow, he was alive. Even so, he couldn’t see a thing since the tunnel’s emergency lighting had been knocked offline. In the dark, he rolled away from the steady downpour, and stopped in a crouch when a man howled.   
	“Name?” Griffith hollered.
	“Dagon,” the man grunted before he yelled back, “now, get off my damn ankle!”
	Griffith felt around with his outstretched right hand, with nothing in his way, he stepped to the right. 
Letting out a ragged sigh, Dagon hissed, “hey, take your time, man. It’s not like it’s broken or anything.”
Digging through his multiple pockets, Griffith retrieved a tiny LED light. He thumbed the switch, and positioned the LED above his head. In the soft edges of the white glow, Griffith saw that Dagon wore the uniform of a palace guard, albeit, so battered he’d never again pass inspection in it. “Where’s everyone else?” Griffith asked as he brought the light down to Dagon’s ankle. The sight of protruding bone flipped Griffith’s stomach. He bit down on his tongue, holding back the urge to vomit.   
“Probably just getting to Bunker 12. Jameson said he’d be back with a stretcher. Wish he’d hurry,” Dagon said through clenched teeth. 
It took Griffith a half a second to decide they couldn’t wait. If the shelling in this section of the palace continued, this little piece of tunnel would soon collapse. “I’m gonna get you out of here,” Griffith said.
The disabled palace guard stared at Griffith, who was at least six inches shorter and a good 50 pounds lighter. Dagon muttered, “man, I don’t think that’s gonna work.”
“I guess you don’t recognize me,” Griffith spit. “I’m Alec Griffith, three time power-lifting champion of Pu’Shing Bhu’Tons. I was headed for the world championship before this bloody war broke out. Now, lay out.” 
In the feeble LED light, Dagon took a second look at the stocky Mercurian. He didn’t know if the man spoke the truth, Dagon had never bothered to follow sports of any kind, let alone power-lifting. Seeing no other option, he reluctantly laid back. 
Griffith dropped his mini-LED onto Dagon’s stomach. The Mercurian stretched out his muscles and did a couple of squats, while calculating the best way to lift a 6-foot tall, 200-pound man. The weight and the length weren’t the problem, the lacking bar and grips were. Where the hell was he supposed to put his hands? Griffith opted for the damsel-in-distress mode of carry, slipping one hand through the crook of Dagon’s knees and the other behind his shoulders. “Count of three. Hold my neck,” Griffith ordered. “One. Two.” He simultaneously heaved up and balanced the weight squarely over his feet. Gravity pulled on Dagon’s dangling ankle, he cursed into Griffith’s ear causing the Mercurian to growl, “shut up before I drop you!” They stayed like that for the few seconds it took Griffith to steady himself. When Griffith was ready he exhaled, groaned, and somehow managed to stand upright. With deliberation, Griffith stepped forward. Once the weight was redistributed, he took another step. In that slow and steady pace, they made it ten yards to Junction 12 when a third explosion caved in the area they’d just left. The force of the blast shoved them through the intersection where they landed in a tangle of limbs. 
Screaming bloody murder, Dagon scrambled out from under an unconscious Griffith, who had knocked his unprotected head on the corner where the passageways intersected. Griffith’s mini-LED lit up a dim circle three feet away. Dagon dragged himself toward the light. The hardest part of crawling with a nearly dismembered foot is wrapping one’s head around the idea that that particular foot and leg are no longer useable for leveraging weight. When he finally reached it, he was covered in sweat and on the verge of passing out or puking. After he hurled, he chastised himself for being weak. He had to find a comm terminal, their lives depended on it. For all he knew Jameson had gotten to the bunker and decided it wasn’t safe enough to risk more men. If he could contact Bunker 12, he could reassure them he was still alive. Holding the tiny light above his head, Dagon searched the passage walls for the winged eye logo that indicated one of Mercury’s communication stations. Having been on the security team assigned to monitor the installation technicians, Dagon knew there was a terminal at every junction. The trick would be to locate the correct wall before he passed out. He didn’t even have to touch the damn thing, he just needed to get close enough to give it verbal commands. 
The third wall Dagon searched, on the crossroad right of where they landed—a left if they could have simply walked from the ballroom escape hatch—was where he found the winged eye. “Oh, thank you!” Dagon exclaimed. 
The wings flapped, the eye blinked, and a computerized woman’s voice spoke, “I am Iphi. How may I assist you, today?” 
“Contact Bunker 12.”
“Please wait while I connect you,” Iphi said. Succulent pipes and a soft beating drum, issued out of the overhead speakers. “Your party is currently unavailable. How may I assist you, today?”
“Damn it!” Dagon cursed.
“I’m sorry. I don’t recognize that command. How may I assist you, today?”
Dagon lay on his side, holding the tiny LED light in one hand, and staring into the darkness beyond the light’s little circle of radiance. He groaned, then said, “Iphi, contact all the bunkers on this wing.” 
“If you would like to start a conference call, please say, ‘Conference.’ If you’d like to reach each party individually ple—”
“Conference!” Dagon shouted.
“Please wait while I connect you,” an unperturbed Iphi said. Once again, the innocent sounds of Pan issued out of the speakers.
“Bunkers 7 through 12 are currently unavailable. Please wait while Bunkers 1 through 6 load,” Iphi announced. Dagon watched as the winged eye blinked and flapped around the screen. “Bunker 1 and 2 are now ready.”
“Hello?” Dagon spoke loudly, “can you hear me?”
“Yes. No need to shout, boyo,” an older woman answered. 
“Who is this?” a man asked.
“Captain Sebastian Dagon.”
“Bunker 3 through 6 are now available,” Iphi announced.
“Someone calling?” 
“What’s going on?”
“Everybody, please! Just listen,” Dagon commanded. The various voices stopped. “I’m trapped in Junction 12. I’ve got a Mercurian with me. Jameson was supposed to come back with a stretcher. But, I can’t raise Bunker 12. We need help.”
A series of mutterings and incomprehensible over-talking began as six people began speaking. Suddenly, a throaty woman yelled, “by the power invested in me as Consul of Pu’Shing Bhu’Tons, I command you all to shut up.” At once the only noise Dagon could hear was the steady stream of raining rocks and the shifting of bombed debris. “Captain,” Consul Margret Daring began, “that wing of the palace has been destroyed. You’re lucky to be alive. Bunker 6 is now the closest to you. Bunker 6?”
“Yes, Consul?” a timid fellow answered.
“Do you have anyone available?” 
“Um. Well. Yes.”
“Good. Send them to Captain Dagon.”
“As you command,” the timid fellow said.
“Hold on, Captain,” Consul Daring ordered. 
“Yes s’m,” he slurred as he passed out.

	Alec Griffith came to under the brilliant white overhead light of an examining table. To his left, as yet still unconscious, lay Dagon. A scrawny silver-haired man leaned his wrinkled face close to Griffith’s. The man lifted up one of Griffith’s eyelids, saying “pupils are dilating. That’s good. Can you hear me?” 
	“Wh-hat?” Griffith groggily asked. 
	“Can you hear me?”
	“Uh. Yes.”
	“Excellent,” the man smiled a gap-toothed grin. To someone outside of Griffith’s range of vision, the old man said, “this one is fine.”
	The person to whom he spoke replied in an androgynous voice, “then, Dr. Slaughter I presume I can commence?”
	Dr. Slaughter chuckled, “commence away. Though, I’d at least wait until both of his eyes open.”
	“There isn’t time,” the androgynous voice soured, “it’s too important. Alec Griffith?” As the owner of the voice came into view, Griffith saw a handsome young man with high cheekbones and a dimpled chin. “Did you succeed?”
	Griffith had listened to the exchange, but was still too dazed to comprehend that they were discussing him. “Suc-ceed?” 
	“Focus, Griffith. It’s me. It’s Tomlin. Did you succeed?”
	He flashed on the two of them in a closed meeting with the CEO of Mercury, Inc., Phil Motown, and Consul Margaret Daring. In his mind’s eye, Griffith could see a map of greater Pu’Shing Bhu’Tons with the Iphigenia Palace as the centralized capitol. Ridiculous. What a waste of money and resources. There’s no reason what-so-ever for a monstrosity that size, he thought. On the map, the palace stretched further than the Calypso Mountains and was twice the width of the Antigone Plains. The sharp sting of the slap brought him out of his reverie, “ow, damn you! That hurt.”
	“For the last time,” Tomlin said as he rubbed his hand, “did you succeed?”
	“Yes!” Griffith answered. 
“Even with the bombing?” 
“Go for launch.”
	Tomlin sagged as a wave of relief passed through him, “I’ll tell her!” The young man raced out of Griffith’s sight. He heard the distinct sound of an automatic door swishing open and then closed. 
	“It’s none of my business, boyo,” Dr. Slaughter whispered, “what are we launching?”
	“You’re right. It’s none of your business,” Griffith grumbled.
	The doctor nodded his silvery head and patted Griffith on the shoulder, “figured you say so. When you can sit up, you can leave. I’m sure you’ve got plenty of next-level shit to handle.”
	“Dagon?”
	“He’s not going anywhere until we amputate.”
	“His foot,” Griffith said. “It looked bad.”
	Dr. Slaughter snorted, “you have a way with words. If we’re lucky the hospital won’t be too far gone and we’ll recover materials for prosthetics. Otherwise, he won’t be walking out of here.”
	“We’ll be lucky if any of us walk out,” Griffith spit. “When’s the last time you were topside, doc?”
	“Two weeks. Consul ordered East wing down after the first bombs,” he paused in thought, “my kids were…were unable to reach me before they sealed the wing.” The color drained from his cheeks, “they’re in school to be doctors. Of course, neither of them want to be a surgeon like their poppa. Erin wants to be a veterinarian. She loves animals. And Evan wants to be a general practioner. He says with good GPs no one will ever need a surgeon. I told him his logic is faulty.”
	“If they’re up at the university, they should be fine.”
“You know the law says they have to work while they’re in school. That’s why they couldn’t get to me. They both work as environmental technicians in the Southeastern wing. They were supposed to be evacuated to Bunker 12.” The doctor leaned over Griffith, deep worry lines etched in his brow, “they say you two were in Junction 12. Can you tell me anything?”         
 “Last thing I remember, I was flying through the air with that fool,” Griffith nodded his head toward Dagon. “What bunker is this?”
“Six. We haven’t been able to reach half the bunkers on this side of Iphigenia.” Dr. Slaughter bowed his head. 
“I barely made it through the hatch before the Grand Ballroom was demolished. I’m sure one of those blasts knocked comms down.” He leaned on his elbows, it was the first effort he’d taken to sit up and it made his head spin and ears ring. “How do I get to Bunker 2 from here?”
Hollow laughter rang out, “you that special?”
“What?”
“You that special?” Dr. Slaughter repeated himself.
“Not special,” Griffith smiled, “I’m a Mercurian on a mission.”
“Oh,” the doctor breathed. “Go into the Common Room. Tell Joshua you need a clear route. He’ll tell Iphi to show you the way.”

	Inside Bunker 2, Phil Motown and Consul Daring were making last minute preparations for launch based on the report from Isaac Tomlin. The escape craft was prepped and the 200 high-priority evacuees had already been loaded. The coordinates for the decoys were already entered into Iphi’s automated guidance system. Consul Daring authorized launch using her two-factor authentication keys. After Motown used his, Iphi would begin the countdown to launch the decoys and the escape craft. 
	“Are you sure you want to do this?” Motown asked.
	“Want? I don’t see any other choice, do you?” the consul replied bitterly.
	“You’re talking about releasing the entire nuclear arsenal.”
	“Not talking. Talk is over. We’ve confirmed the last coordinate. Your key.”
 	“There’s no coming back. Our children’s children won’t even be able to come back.”
	“Phil,” Consul Daring’s tone was filled with sorrow, “this was our contingency plan. We all knew it could come to this. That’s why we built up the space station. Talk is over.” She nodded to the control panel where a winged eye floated, “your key.”
	Phil Motown closed his eyes. He walked over to the communication terminal and commanded, “Iphi, we are go for launch.”
	“Voice command, Phillip William Motown, recognized. Please touch your key to the terminal.” 
Motown waved his wrist in front of the winged eye. The eye blinked and the wings flapped, indicating the system was loading.   
“Key recognized. Launch in t-minus fifteen minutes. If you would like to cancel, please do so in the next ten minutes. Once ten minutes has passed, the override will be inaccessible. Are you sure you want to continue?”
“You heard her,” Motown said, “we can still cancel.”
“Don’t be a fool,” Daring said. “This is Consul Margret Daring, confirm launch, Iphi.”
“Launch confirmed, Consul Daring. Please proceed to the escape vehicle. Launch in t-minus fourteen minutes.”

	Alec Griffith hit the last passageway to Bunker 2 and immediately knew he was too late. The ground shook. The walls groaned. The unmistakable sound of a plethora of rockets roared through the passage. They left without him. He turned to the rumbling wall and futilely beat both fists against it while spitting out every cuss word he’d ever heard. If the enemy, the unbending nitwits from Angary, were to launch a counter strike both lands would devolve into a nuclear winter that would eventually wipe out any- and everything above ground. Think, Alec. He suddenly couldn’t believe he’d told Tomlin they were ‘go.’ What the hell had he been thinking? Okay, Alec. What are you going to do now, boyo? The Mercurian struck the wall one last time, before sprinting the rest of the way to Bunker 2. He waved his wrist in front of the security panel and heard the locks disengage. With a bit of a grunt he swung the hatch open. He stepped over the knee-knocker and charged into the Common Room where he found Isaac Tomlin resting on a black leather couch.   
	“What are you doing?” Griffith yelled at Tomlin.
	“Waiting for you,” Tomlin calmly responded. “What does it look like?”
	“You idiot. Why aren’t you onboard?”
	“I hate to fly. You know that.”
	“You’d rather die down here?”
	“Oh, come on, Griffith. This place is secure. There’s food enough for now. And, with proper care, there’ll be plenty in the future.”
	“The nukes?”
	“Oh, yes. The whole arsenal is gone. It was always the plan. Launch everything at the Angarians, that way they can’t stop the escape. Our fearless leaders and their chosen few will live out their days in the confines of the space station, floating unending circles around the planet they nuked. Perhaps one day, if they planned correctly, they’ll be able to return. If so, it won’t be during our life time.”
	Griffith sat down heavily on the edge of the couch. He thought of Dagon, the doctor and his kids. With shoulders slumped and head bowed, he said, “I can’t believe they did it.” 
	“What’s not to believe? You told me they were go.”
 	“I got the message from Justin. The Angarians weren’t going to stop the bombardment.”
	“Well, there you go. So, what’s your problem?”
	“I killed the world.”
	“Don’t you think that’s a little drastic for a couple of Mercury’s messengers?”
	Griffith pulled his head up and glared at Tomlin, “‘a little drastic,’ my ass! If I hadn’t told you, then you couldn’t have told them.”
	“And, if Justin hadn’t told you…blah, blah. It’s over now. Missiles are flying through the air and at some point in the very near future they will land on both continents. We can’t do squat about it, can we?”
	“No.”
	“Right. So. You and me, pal. We’re officially the only two people with access to the top level Bunkers. We’re repositories of top secret information and the only ones still down here with full computer access. So, guess what.”
	“What?”
	“We’ve just been promoted,” a sly smile rose on Tomlin’s lips, “Griffith, I only have one question for you.”
	“What?”
	“Do you want to be consul or shall I?”
